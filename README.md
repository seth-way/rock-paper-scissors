### Context:

[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

- This app was built as the final Mod 1 solo project in Week 5/6 of Turing's FE Software Development Bootcamp.
- It is meant to demonstrate web-dev skills in JS, HTML, CSS & DOM manipulation.
- It took roughly 6 days or 20+ hours to complete.

### Contributors:

### Learning Goals:

[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

- This project will reinforce my learning of Javascript, HTML, & CSS.

### Wins + Challenges:

[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
- This project challenged my understanding of CSS animations & async delays. It was difficult, but rewarding to create a seamless UX, while keeping possible bugs out of the DOM during delays.
- The 'console' was a complicated & layered element that required carefull planning and manipulation to create. Parts needed to be hidden and cursor events disabled as necessary to elimate unwanted DOM activities.
- This is the most complex CSS I have built to date & required research in CSS variables, color blending, @keyframe animations, transitions, and layering through absolute-positioning. I'm very pleased with the final product.
